# IoT-Traffic-Light
The prototype of the intelligent traffic control device with the support of the "green wave" mode was developed. 
The "green wave" mode is implemented with a mobile gadget simulating an on-board computer for a special service vehicle.

The algorithm of the intellectual traffic light is represented in the form of a temporal graph with the transition of the control automaton. 
The control unit is based on the microcontroller with the Wi-Fi module ESP-12E (ESP8266).
The microcontroller is programmed in the programming language SI in the Arduino IDE environment using the automaton template.

The model of the traffic light is realized on the basis of colored LEDs: red - R314D-L, yellow - LY 2040, green - FYL-5013 UGD.
 
The mobile part of the system is implemented on the Android platform in the C # programming language.
The mobile control device (cloud part of the system) is implemented on the basis of a mobile device on the Android platform.
